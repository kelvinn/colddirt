			<h4>What is a "cold dirt"?</h4>
			<p>Think back over your life, can you remember anything that you did to somebody that was a little, <i>cold</i>?  Do you have some dirt on somebody? Does somebody have some dirt on you?  Colddirt is a Sinful Aggregator, so c'mon, <a href="/yourdirt/">admit your dirt</a>.</p>
			<h4>How many of these "cold dirt" things have people submitted?</h4>
			<span id="dirtcount" class="bigblue">0</span> have been submitted by users like you!
			<h4>Why was this site created?</h4>
			<p>One Thursday afternoon I thought: "hmm, I have this idea for a site in the back of my mind, about people confessing stuff.  And giving everybody one word from the alphabet per submission. I wonder if I can get it done in one day then release the source so people a) know I'm not collecting infromation and b) let others learn a few tricks, maybe."  I asked an old work colleague to toss together a dirty looking banner, and by the time I left the cafe Colddirt was 90% done.  On Friday I decided to add some nifty stuff like syndication (RSS), sitemaps and AJAX.</p>
			<h4>One day! What the.</h4>
			<p>You can thank the <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com">Django Web Framework</a> for this.  Another colleague recommended I learn it a few months ago, and I've been hooked ever since.  Their slogan is "for perfectionists with deadlines," but I think it should be "Django: making web stuff fun."  Seriously, it is actually fun.</p>
